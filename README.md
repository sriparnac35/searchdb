# searchdb
The aim of this project is to create a log-based database which currently supports basic CRUD operations.
Currently this supports data storage on only a single node. This will be subsequently further enhanced to be distributed : supporting data replication and sharding.

Sample usage can be found in SearchDBApplication.java
